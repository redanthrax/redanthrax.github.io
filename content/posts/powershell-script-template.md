Powershell script template for RMM and general use.

Recently I've been running [Tactical RMM](https://github.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm)
and luckily for most of my scripts I have taken an "RMM Agnostic" approach to
my scripting techniques. From using that technique a type of template has emerged
which I will immortalize here.

## Example Usage
